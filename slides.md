## Making Lua Fast

---

### We Want Lua Programs to Be Fast

What are our options?

- LuaJIT?
- Rewrite it in C?

---

### LuaJIT

- State-of-art JIT compiler for Lua, but...
- Only supports Lua 5.1
- Hard to develop and maintain
- Unpredictable speedups

---

### Idioms Specific to LuaJIT

For instance, caching global functions in local variables.

```
-- Bad
local function mytan(x)
	return math.sin(x) / math.cos(x)
end

-- Good
local sin, cos = math.sin, math.cos
local function mytan(x)
	return sin(x) / cos(x)
end
```

---

But you shouldn't cache FFI functions to locals!

```
-- Good (!)
local function hello()
	C.printf("Hello, world!")
end

-- Bad (!)
local printf = C.printf
local function hello()
	printf("Hello , world!")
end
```

---

### Not Yet Implemented

LuaJIT is not able to compile some Lua features, hence the performance
improvement might not be that good.

- pairs
- string.gsub
- table.sort
- creating closures
- ...

---

### Rewrite it in C

- C-API is great, but...
- Might be difficult for newcomers
- Requires a lot of effort
- It is hard to know in advance if it will be worth it

---

## The Pallene Language

---

### What is Pallene?

Pallene is a companion language for Lua that relies on a static type system and
ahead-of-time compiler to achieve good performance.  

---

Pallene is an academic research project on programing languages at LabLua by
Hugo, myself, and Roberto.

Also check out the original project made by Andre, Fabio, Hisham, Hugo, SÃ©rgio,
and me:

---

### Pallene Should

- Be amenable to standard ahead-of-time compiler optimization techniques
- Be familiar to Lua programmers, syntactically and semantically
- Share the Lua runtime, using the same data representation and the same GC

---

### Dynamic Type System

It is very hard to infer those types and generate fast code.

```
function sum(arr)
	local s = 0
	for i = 1, #arr do
		s = s + arr[i]
	end
	return s
end
```

---

For instance, it could be sending e-mails under the hood.

```
local mt = {
	__len = function(self)
		return #self.emails
	end,
	__index = function(self, i)
		if email.send(self.emails[i]) then
			return 1
		else
			return 0
		end
	end,
}
```

---

### Static Type System

Types limit Pallene's semantics compared to Lua, but they also allow the
compiler to generate fast code ahead of time.

```
function sum(arr: {integer}): integer
	local s = 0
	for i = 1, #arr do
		s = s + arr[i]
	end
	return s
end
```

---

### Interation Between Lua and Pallene

Pallene is able to manipulate Lua's data structures directly.

```
--- Lua code
local array = require'array' -- Pallene library
local a = {1, 2, 3}
print(array.sum(a))
```

---

### Pallene Semantics

Pallene tries to keep the Lua semantics as much as possible.
For instance, a function won't coerce an integer argument to a float parameter.

```
-- Pallene Code:
function add(x: float, y:float): float
	return x + y
end
-- Lua Code:
local big = 18014398509481984 print(add(big, 1) == big)
```

---

### Gradual Guarantee

Pallene is not forced to yield a type error if `copy` receives an array of
strings.

```
function copy(xs: {integer}): {integer}
	local ys: {integer} = {}
	for i = 1, #xs do
		ys[i] = xs[i]
	end
	return ys
end
```

---

### Generating Fast Code Ahead Of Time

Pallene specializes each instruction to the given type and bypass the Lua-C API.

```
int sum(Table *arr)
{
	lua_Integer s = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i != luaH_getn(arr); i++)
	{
		lua_Integer tmp = pallene_get_integer(arr, i);
		s = s + tmp;
	}
	return s;
}
```

---

### Arrays in Pallene

- Pallene uses the same underlying structure that the Lua interpreter does
- According to the gradual guarantee, Pallene code should either behave like
  the equivalent (untyped) Lua code or raise a type error

---

### Array access

The generated code is very specialized when compared to what the Lua
interpreter does.

```
lua_Integer pallene_get_integer(Table *arr, int i)
{
	if (i >= arr->array_capacity)
		resize_array_part(arr, i);
	TValue *slot = &xs->array[i];
	if (slot->tag != LUA_INTEGER)
		pallene_type_error();
	return slot->ivalue;
}
```
